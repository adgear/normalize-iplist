= normalize-iplist

This gem provides some relatively fast methods for working with lists
of IP addresses and networks.

To build and test:

  rake build test

== TODO

* reworking the name and API to be more obvious and self-descriptive

* documentation

* coalescing of adjacent netmasks (like cidrmerge)
  (presently we only coalesce adjacent sequences of /32)
